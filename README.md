# Requirements for a Collection to be exportable as a ProQuest package:

* When creating the Collection, should set "ProQuest ETD" as one of its resource types.
* Once the "ProQuest ETD" resource type being chosen, a ProQuest-specific form will be displayed and needs to be filled in.
* Among all the fields in the ProQuest-specific form, the author's last name and first name fields are required fields.
* You can upload exactly one main ETD generic file and none or multiple supplementary generic files into this Collection.
* The main ETD generic file should have one of its resource types set as "Main ProQuest ETD PDF" and the file format should be in PDF.
* Before exporting the Collection along with its generic files as a ProQuest package, the system will check if the Collection has exactly one main ETD PDF file, otherwise, the export button will be unclickable.
